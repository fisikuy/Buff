Introduction: A New Vantage Point


Bugs. Sometimes, something just bugs you.1 A worm in your ear. We have all had the experience. You are going about your day, and something prompts you to wonder. You mull it over. You try on this explanation or that one. And then you get distracted and you move on. Or maybe you don’t, and the worm digs in deeper. Or maybe you do, but the worm returns to its wriggling later that night. You can’t shake it off. Maybe you pull out your phone or strike a few keys—or turn to a colleague or ping a friend. Gosh, now you really want to know! Perhaps you hit a few walls—paywalls or prejudices, differences of opinion or the limits of science, or even congenial scoffing at your pet project. Depending on who you are, you might also encounter outright sexism or racism, classism or ableism—all ways of telling you that your bug is a bust. Forget this fleeting interest and focus on something that matters. Regardless, let’s say, you carry on. Maybe the kids are screaming, or you are in a meeting, or you drive to the store for milk. Despite bombastic blasts from every corner, you hold onto what’s bugging you, refusing to let it bugger off. And then it happens . . . your mind begins to dance and to weave. Collecting the bits of things that might be relevant and stitching them together. So builds the briefest of webs. Perhaps it was a silkworm after all! This is your brain on curiosity.

And you are in good company. Rewind back to 1928, if you will. Author Virginia Woolf is sitting on the banks of a river (the Thames, perhaps, or the Cam, or the Isis) and she has a worm in her ear: women and fiction. What even are they? she wonders. “Questions,” she calls them, “unsolved problems.” She finds herself walking and thinking, calmly at first and then feverishly. Crisscrossing the Brontë sisters and George Eliot, Charles Lamb and William Thackeray, she wonders not only about women and about fiction but also about their relation and the several ways in which it can be characterized. She strides past the nearby university, a place filled—as she puts it—with obsolete old minds, bereft of body and free of fact, loosed from the roughshod rambling toward truth that she is currently undertaking.2 And then there it is!

Thought—to call it by a prouder name than it deserved—had let its line down into the stream. It swayed, minute after minute, hither and thither, among the reflections and the weeds, letting the water lift it and sink it, until—you know the little tug—the sudden conglomeration of an idea at the end of one’s line.3

This is curious thought. Holding out a line. Casting and recasting it. Waiting patiently, watching the river, the waves, the light, sinking into the circle of life. Until suddenly you feel it: a series of nibbles, then tugs, and then slowly something coalesces there on the end of your line. Lines of thought agglutinate. They weave themselves together and take shape, gaining felt sense and even power. Aha!

But the challenge of it all is not simply patience. It is also the conundrums and the curtailments. What sort of fish did she find? Was it an as yet undiscovered and unnamed specimen? Or was it a species common to the area, such as a carp perhaps or a perch? Was it a mutant fish, strange from the start? Or was it a chimera of a fish, some fin-bearing aquatic creature that only medievalists can fully appreciate? Would taxonomies need to bend for it or break? Or would they simply breeze by it? What in fact was it she discovered? What inkling took shape for her in an instant? We will never know, for she was quickly accosted by an old-fashioned version of the campus police. She had wandered onto the college green, where women were forbidden. “He was a Beadle; I was a woman. This was the turf; there was the path.” She rights herself forthwith and heads for the library, only to be informed at the door that she needs a man to escort her in. Alas! She is out walking alone. In both cases, she laments, “They had sent my little fish into hiding.” Determined, she returns to casting her line, over and over again, until the arc of her queries weaves a tapestry: A Room of One’s Own. In this masterful piece, she puts two and two together: thinking requires the freedom to fish, or “a woman must have money and a room of her own if she is to write fiction.”4

In Curious Minds, we start right there, with the architectures of (and for) curious thought itself. How does curiosity move, and how does it build? What are the neural, epistemic, and social bases of that building? How does your brain connect disparate ideas and string together concepts? How does it reconfigure old notions and weave together new ones? Do different people practice curiosity in different ways, building knowledge configurations of different shapes and styles? And how exactly do we practice curiosity together? What does it mean to track down shared hunches? Or to cross-pollinate curiosities across cultures? Is it even possible to characterize how curiosity feels and functions on these multiple registers? And what happens when curiosity falters? By what neural substrates, social structures, or cultural strictures does curiosity get curtailed? For that matter, what would it mean to facilitate the dynamic force of curiosity equitably, cultivating greater freedom of inquiry and counteracting long-standing patterns of epistemic hierarchy? These and so many other questions fuel the book in front of you.

For too long—and still too often—curiosity has been oversimplified. In everyday parlance, it is frequently reduced to the simple act of raising a hand or voicing a question, especially from behind a desk or a podium. Or to turning an object this way, then that, or perhaps simply “googling” something. Scholars generally boil it down to “information-seeking” behavior or a “desire to know.” But curiosity is more than a feeling and certainly more than an act. And curiosity is always more than a single move or a single question. From the toddler to the most well-trained scholars, it is rarely if ever a straight shot. Curiosity comes in waves—mutating, agglomerating, washing ashore, and washing back out again. Each wave breaks by spilling, plunging, surging, or collapsing. Curiosity is as much the brisk steps in search of a new vantage point as it is the silent daydreaming by a river’s edge. What falls out of most quotidian—and even scholarly—characterizations of it are the lines that make curiosity what it is. The wandering tracks, the weaving concepts, the knitting of ideas, and the thatching of knowledge systems. In a word, the very essence of curious movement in conceptual and physical space. What gets lost are the networks, the relations, between ideas and between people.

In this book, we offer a new theory of curiosity. Drawing on our own fields of complex systems and neuroscience, literature and philosophy, we propose a network account of curiosity.5 For us, curiosity is a network practice, a relational practice. It works by linking ideas, facts, perceptions, sensations, and data points together. Yet it also works within human grids of friendship, society, and culture. Rambling over vast interdisciplinary terrain—as we are wont to do—we develop an account that is as relevant to the humanities and the sciences as it is to everyday life. When you query, you connect. And you thread not simply one piece and another together but also within a constantly changing web of individual and collective knowledge. Importantly, that curious connection is never just free play. As Woolf so deftly dramatizes, we weave our knowledge webs within existing contexts rife with constraints—constraints not only in the epistemic architectures of knowledge but in the social architectures of knowers too. Here in these pages, we tackle that complexity. Curiosity connects. And it does so within the connective tissues of brain and body, system and society.

And that matters.

Curiosity across the Ages
Curiosity is as old as the hills, and the study of curiosity itself has a long and storied history. Given its presumed affinity for all things intellect, curiosity has typically been divorced from the body—and from society for that matter—and located instead in the individual organ of thought. But of course that organ is quite slippery, having been understood differently across the vagaries of time. Thousands of years ago, it was believed that curiosity lived in the seat of the soul. Following the medieval period and the Renaissance, curiosity slowly took up residence in the mind. Then with the development of early psychology and neuroscience, curiosity has most recently been located somewhere in the brain—with its precise coordinates still up for debate. Regardless of where curiosity is situated, its consistent restriction to the mental apparatus has been accompanied by a steady divorce from material bodies and community relations. Curiosity has been isolated. But the tide is turning. The deeper we head into the brain, the more impossible that isolation is to sustain. The mass of humanity exerts an unquestionable gravitational force pulling us outward. Reckoning with the network substrate of the brain sends us scrambling back out to account for the many other networks within which curiosity works. As the tides turn, our waves of inquiry pull sand and seaweed away from shore. Appreciating the multiple architectures that make thought possible—whether neural, knowledge, or social networks—is in fact crucial not only to account for curiosity but also to practice it intentionally.

Saint Augustine is credited with perhaps the earliest and most definitive account of curiosity in the Western canon. A well-educated North African rhetorician in Numidia, Augustine converted to Christianity at the age of thirty-one and went on to become a church bishop, writing definitive treatises in the faith. For Augustine, curiosity resides in the soul.6 Sometimes he characterizes it as a “lust of the eyes,” or a cupidinous interest to see and to know things of earthly but not eternal import. At other times he depicts it as a form of “lower reason,” which turns the light of the soul dim with fleshly desire and delight in secular learning. Whatever the specific formulation, Augustine understands curiosity as a formidable force that moves the soul away from God and Christian fellowship, drawing it ever deeper into the epistemic intrigues of a mutable, corruptible world. As such, it is a “disease,” he says, that disrupts the order of creation and wrenches an individual human from their proper place in it. Now, while we have long relinquished the conviction that curiosity is a sin, we have held onto a sense that curiosity lives in the soul, or at least in that part of us where we wonder, learn, doubt, and remember. Augustine’s account is, then, a direct predecessor of psychological and neuroscientific accounts of curiosity today.

But there is an intermediary step. As the Roman Catholic empire waned, early modern science arose and, with it, the unabashed celebration of all the elements of scientific inquiry: observation and hypotheses, yes, but also curiosity. Against all the religious vitriol curiosity had sustained, Francis Bacon, onetime lord chancellor of England and staunch proponent of empiricism, defends it, characterizing it as absolutely “natural” and in fact “useful” when tasked with building knowledge in the service of humankind.7 Similarly, René Descartes, French mathematician and cornerstone of modern philosophy, naturalizes the intellectual impetus to inquire and to explore. Curiosity and wonder, he says, are both located in the mind, where “animal spirits” (forces carried in the blood) hold up different perceptual impressions before the mind’s eye. In the case of wonder, the spirits are staid and calm; in the case of curiosity, they are a bit jittery and quick. Through the sibling emotion (or as Descartes has it, the “passion”) of generosity, curiosity and wonder can fuel the organism’s acquisition of knowledge beneficial to society as a whole.8 Lifting curiosity from the soul and to the mind, then, the early modern period directly links it to the biologically rooted inner eye. From there, the brain is not far behind.

In contemporary psychology and neuroscience, curiosity is located in the brain and, depending on the study, in specific parts of the brain. This localization makes good sense given that these fields currently understand curiosity to be an information-seeking behavior that is driven to fill information gaps. Curiosity would then naturally be located in the information processing center: the brain.9 But where in the brain? Psychologist Daniel Berlyne locates curiosity in the interplay between the reticular arousal system and “neural assemblies” in the cerebral cortex.10 In the subsequent work of neuroscientist Jacqueline Gottlieb, data scientist Min Jeong Kang, and psychologist Celeste Kidd, among others, curiosity has migrated across gray matter tracks depending upon the object of study. When curiosity is associated with exploration, it appears in the frontopolar cortex, intraparietal sulcus, or posterior cingulate cortex; with novelty, it appears in the ventral striatum; with trivia, in the caudate nucleus and inferior frontal gyrus; with learning and memory, in the hippocampus, dopaminergic regions, and nucleus accumbens; or with attention and decision-making, in the frontoparietal system.11 And while the nervous system extends throughout the body, and is tuned by environmental and social factors, today’s science rightly insists that the brain—and its contribution to curiosity—is importantly unique.

The deeper into the brain you press, however, the farther back out you have to pivot. There, in fold after fold of gelatinous tissue, are masses of cell nuclei, axons, and synapses, shuttling electrical signals this way and that in a riotous web of neural activity. Far from chaotic, those neurons work in clusters, yes, but also across clusters. And these clusters swing and even dance. They do so, moreover, in ways partially determined by genetic and epigenetic substrates, environmental influences (both present and past), and social interactions. This is a complex system if there ever was one. A veritable symphony. To its credit, network science—building on sociology, art theory, and philosophy from the 1960s and 1970s—provides a renewed invitation to attend to these networks in the brain, but also to the knowledge networks and social networks within which that complex neural system functions. The field summons us to appreciate the network architectures not only of the thinking organ but also of thought itself as well as thinkers of today and yesteryear. In this book, we heed that call.

And none too soon. In the epic march from soul to mind to brain, we have lost touch with some things along the way. We have lost track of the networks. We have largely forgotten to wonder how curiosity builds or breaks community, whether with other humans or with a more-than-human reality. We have largely forgotten to ask about curiosity’s relationship to emotions, to trauma, and to other affective bodily phenomena. We have hardly wondered where else in the body curiosity is lodged. And we have left largely unexplored curiosity’s relationship to bodily movement—or kinesthetics—as a whole. We believe so heartily that curiosity is crucial to societal achievement, moreover, that we have spent little energy in cultivating its attunement with societal generosity. And we have barely paused to ask just what links are activated (or lie dormant) between curiosity and culture, social values, and even politics.12

There is so much left to investigate! Foregrounding curiosity as connectional allows us to turn renewed attention to the brain as a complex system. It prompts us to ask what insights other complex systems—such as language or music—might provide in the project of probing the curious mind. It also attunes our attentions to the epistemic and social systems that enable the brain to function in the first place. It prompts us to ask about the organ of learning itself, and simultaneously about the architecture of what is learned and the arrangement of learners in the process. To really understand curiosity, after all, it matters not simply with what and how one learns but with whom and where as well. As such, the network account we propose invites ever-richer circuits of analysis, opening up a whole new world behind and ahead of us.

Footpaths and Flight Ways
In Curious Minds, we trace a path through this network of questions. In no way do we imagine that this is the only, or indeed the most direct, course. We would be disappointed if it were. Rather, we hope the path takes on a life of its own. Sometimes we hue closely to what we know and at other times we stretch out to touch what we do not yet know. We try our footing, we reroute our flight. We take our coordinates from the depth of the humanities and the height of the sciences by turns. In so doing, we marvel at and blithely explore the vast landscape that a network approach opens up for the study of curiosity.

In chapter 1, “The Science of Curiosity,” we begin by noting the centrality of curiosity to the very spirit and practice of science. There is no science without curiosity. We then turn to the contemporary science of curiosity, focusing on the recent contributions of psychology and neuroscience. Studies in psychology utilize quantitative and qualitative measurements to understand the function of curiosity, while studies in neuroscience make use of brain-imaging techniques (e.g., functional magnetic resonance imaging [fMRI]) to identify the neural substrates of curiosity. Whatever the methods, each field has made immense strides in illuminating the behavioral and neural components of information seeking. There remains, however, an important limitation to this work. It functions largely on the information gap theory, according to which curiosity is an intrinsic motivation to fill a knowledge gap. Within an information-seeking framework, curiosity remains acquisitional, a project of acquiring—and amassing—information. But this is not curiosity’s only function.

In chapter 2, “Curiosity as Edgework,” we identify the roots of the acquisitional model of curiosity in the longtime predecessor of psychology and neuroscience: philosophy. Traditionally, philosophy characterizes curiosity as the desire or the appetite to know something. Inspired by network theory, however, we pivot from the paradigm of curiosity as nodal acquisition to curiosity as edgework. We propose a new framework that understands curiosity as a practice of connection, a way of building relations between and among systems of knowers, knowledges, and things known. To develop this framework, we revisit the history of philosophy and excavate a different genealogy for curiosity—one that emphasizes not informational units but relations instead. We find precedent in both Western and Indigenous lineages for this conceptualization of curiosity as a connector rather than conquistador. Finally, we reflect on the immensely promising lines of study that this view poses for psychology and neuroscience today.

In chapter 3, “The Network Paradigm,” we develop the theory of curiosity as edgework through the terminology and methodological resources of network science proper. Specifically, we suggest defining curiosity as a practice of knowledge network building. Drawing on concepts and tools from network science, neuroscience, psychology, and linguistics, we posit that knowledge is a network and that it can in fact be mathematically represented as such. Moreover, if knowledge is a network, and curiosity is the growth principle of that network, then it is theoretically possible to quantitatively characterize and mathematically model that growth using tools from network science. That is, we may be able to graph how ideas slowly accrete into architectures of individual and collective knowledge. Our proposal here formalizes many of the intuitions we have about curiosity as relational, and by that formalization it provides the foundations from which to construct testable hypotheses for future empirical work.

In chapter 4, “Curiosity’s Got Style,” we ask the next logical series of questions. If curiosity is a network building activity, are there different architectures and styles? The equivalent of an Antoni Gaudí and a Frank Lloyd Wright, a Beyoncé and a Nina Simone? And might these differences vary with neural idiosyncrasies, personalities, sociocultural values, and more? In short, we answer “yes.” Diving back into the heart of Western intellectual history, and out past its edges, we identify three styles of curiosity that are relatively consistent across time: the busybody, the hunter, and the dancer. In their curious trajectories, the busybody collects informational tidbits, while the hunter barrels down on one particular interest, and the dancer takes creative leaps of imagination. Each has a distinct kinesthetic signature, creating loose knowledge networks, tight networks, and loopy ones, respectively. In ideational and social spheres, moreover, each style has a unique function, mapping out different routes through knowledge grids and cutting paths across social networks.

In chapter 5, “Webs of Knowledge,” we ask, But are these paths traceable in empirical research? Are styles of building observable in laboratory settings? They are indeed. We report on our study of knowledge network building among users of Wikipedia, where participants spanned from busybodies (who surfed among loosely connected Wikipedia pages) to hunters (who surfed among closely connected pages). Yet this is only the beginning of future work. If people have different styles of knowledge network building, how might those differences affect education or other learning environments and activities? We know that human brains learn clustered or modular networks better than random or disordered ones. Might those clusters be clustered in different ways for different knowers? And how would styles of clustering even be achieved in a learning environment where information is taught linearly through books, lectures, and lesson plans? Ultimately we ask, How might the vast variety of learners’ interests and capacities be best facilitated in and beyond the classroom?

In chapter 6, “Curiosity Takes a Walk,” we pause for a moment. In network science, the path by which one traverses a network is called a “walk,” and different walks on a network conform to different constraints. Likewise, the path by which one traverses a knowledge network can be a walk within specific constraints. The suggestion that walking is a way of thinking—a way of negotiating or generating knowledge—has long roots in the humanistic tradition, as does its converse suggestion: that thinking is a way of walking. Here we investigate four sorts of walks, which themselves involve specific forms of curious thought: the philosophical walk, the spiritual walk, the environmental walk, and the political walk. These ways of moving through physical space map onto ways of moving through conceptual space. We therefore propose that one critical way to cinch together a philosophy and network science of curiosity is precisely by thinking these geographies and graphologies of inquiry together.

In chapter 7, “Your Brain on Curiosity,” we offer our most systematic and experimental account of the network neuroscience of curiosity. Because, as we argue, curiosity is not solely about the acquisition of a piece of knowledge but also about the edgework of connecting pieces of knowledge, we explore not only the relations (and networks) that make up the brain but also the principles by which they may be encoded in the brain, how they are learned and remembered. Drawing as freely from neuroscience as from poetry, music, and even lexicography, we investigate what actually happens in your brain on curiosity. What correspondences does and might the architecture of your brain have with the architectures of the knowledge it produces and processes? Canvasing the function of brain regions and their interrelations, we emphasize the necessary flexibility between them. We then speculate on the current trajectory of neuroscientific inquiry into the neural basis of knowledge network building.

In our final chapter, “Reimagining Education,” we take a step back to appreciate the big picture. If curiosity is best understood as a practice of knowledge network building, of connecting and relating informational bits and informational knowers, what should education look like? How can we reimagine learning differently, more energetically, more equitably? To answer this question, we propose renewed attention to the three key networks involved: neural, social, and knowledge networks. Recognizing the immense diversity that exists within each of these network substructures, we sketch out the paths to a more inclusive, dynamic, and transdisciplinary pedagogy. In that inquiry, we dig deeply into the case studies of neurodiverse writer Naoki Higashida, the civil rights movement’s Freedom Schools, and interdisciplinary scholar par excellence Leonardo da Vinci. Committed to reducing the social inequalities and loosening the traditional disciplinary boundaries that subtend the academy, we aim to facilitate freedom for everyone’s curiosity to pursue seemingly incommensurable ideas and applications.

Curious Minds closes with our own ruminations on the future of curiosity. Anchoring our reflection in our interdisciplinary and social justice commitments, we share what we take to be the next steps in the emancipation of inquiry, the signposts on our journey. As we imagine greater freedom for the dynamism and diversity of curiosity, we think not only of the networks yet to be built but also of the networks that need to crack in order to make room for new building. We close, then, with a rumination on cracks and their role in crafting a more equitable world for all curious minds.

Oscillations
The account we offer here, as with many ideas intertwining minds and fields, has been developed in the patient, sometimes haphazard space of creativity. It has both lurched and lightly danced across time—five years to be exact. The academic life provides all kinds of opportunities for thinking together, whether giving talks or lectures, writing essays, conducting experiments, jumping on Zoom calls, or catching a weekend Islay Scotch (neat). We swapped many a midnight text and daylight delight as this project took shape. For us, it all began with a flight of fancy. What if we were to produce a bit of scholarly work together? Where might our respective areas of expertise meet? In what ways could our fields inform one another? From philosophy to neuroscience, from literature to physics, we noticed that together we revel in ancient and modern ways of thinking about thinking. How, why, what, with whom, and where do we think? On what grounds do we declare, exclaim, or question? As humans, we engage so dramatically with our inner and outer worlds, like soft fuzzy bumblebees wriggling, rambling, and waggling on the miniature flower meadows of spirea bushes. Absolutely enthralled. Completely enmeshed. What is this enchantment that draws us out, draws us in, and calls us to question? Curiosity. Curiosity was the kind of concept that could travel well across the vast space within and between our fields. But curiosity how? We started to sleuth. What do we do as academics, what do we love as humans, and what does that tell us about curiosity, about how we practice it, but also about how we might theorize it? Curious Minds is the record of our journey.

What you have before you, then, is truly a collective effort. The ideas developed here could not have germinated or borne fruit without us thinking together—that is, without our relationship. We practiced curiosity collectively, connecting philosophy and neuroscience, literature and psychology, social justice and network science, so as to build a specific idea, with its very own idiosyncratic knowledge network architecture. That said, for the purposes of the work, we had distinct authorial responsibilities. Dani holds the primary authorship of chapters 1, 3, 5, and 7, while Perry holds the primary authorship of chapters 2, 4, 6, and 8. We have done nothing to mask the distinctiveness of our writing and thinking styles. Rather, we invite readers to come along on our journey. This book is not a monologue but rather a dialogue. And it is not, as such, the most straightforward of books; it does not follow well-trimmed paths. Instead, this is a dynamic investigation, a live-wire query. We gather disparate pieces together, dive down rabbit holes, and leap across vast swaths of cleanly curated space, just to see where we land. And we do that purposively.

But there is also a clear method to the maelstrom, in both form and content. As we toggle between our voices, our fields, and the cadence of our respective walks, we craft an inquiry that expands and contracts as it goes. We call up different canons, explore different peripheries, and take scholastic risks of different altitudes depending on our field-specific expectations. We do this because we believe in the promise of curiosity, but also the pleasure of curiosity. We stretch physics to music and poetry, while we stretch critical theory to graphology and neurology. And there is a flexibility in our partnership here, a little swing dance. You will spot Perry ambling among the archives and see Dani standing still, staring at brain images in the laboratory. But you will also notice Perry sitting down to taxonomize and watch Dani running off to tell stories. What better way to follow the call of curiosity and to court serendipity, though, than to weave between disciplines and ways of knowing, defying borders and boundaries as we go?

As a medium of consilience, we cultivate a literary style, courting an attunement to sound and rhetorical form in a way that enhances our arguments and better equips our explorations. There is a depth of wisdom in language’s flexibility, in the soma of its poetry. In step with that literary quality, moreover, we quote other writers generously, mesmerized by the genius not only of what they say but of how they say it. As thought artists, we work in mixed media, assembling mental material from the twigs and seeds, dyes and putties of language, written across times in various genres and by distinct voices. Implicit here in the work of writers, scholars, and artists centuries in the making are the elemental insights of a network account of curiosity. Furthermore, interweaving the voices of others throughout our journey is no mere ploy of stylistic enrichment or evidentiary justification. Our conceptualization of curiosity as relational necessitates that we draw from and build upon multiple knowers and ways of knowing, whether cradled within our own disciplines and the academy or out past their edge.

There is nevertheless a distinctive anchor for each of us in this inquiry. We are a trained philosopher and physicist, respectively, working in our own fields of critical social theory and network neuroscience. As such, we toggle throughout this book between the mental and the social, between brains and other structures of belonging. In doing so, we behave a bit like mycologists.13 After all, mushrooms typically steal the show, with their big shiny heads, but beneath and around them there stretches mile upon mile of mycelia, a whole underground fungal community. Similarly, the brain typically takes the credit for curiosity, but it functions within a vast interconnective system that makes curiosity possible. In Curious Minds, we shuttle back and forth between the mushrooms and mycelia, the brain and the social body, in order to track curiosity where it lives, across neural and social networks.

We invite our readers to come along on this journey, to take a walk with us. To hold the thread of our argument, but also to revel in the riffs and digressions. The book performs the curiosity of which it speaks. As such, we invite readers not only to appreciate but also to participate—to be curious with the book, not simply about it. Curiosity engages the unknown and relishes in the process of coming to know; it is that path (and not solely the path’s destination) that we celebrate in our writing. We encourage readers to wonder with us, to toggle between the disciplinary resonances, and to dance in this newly choreographed space. What we offer here is an experience as much as an idea. And we do so with the conviction that a robust theory is more powerful than any prescriptive “how-to” manual. Through it, readers of all sorts can reimagine the practice of inquiry in innumerable ways in their everyday lives.

Whys and Wherefores
Imagine that curiosity is less like stockpiling treasures than swinging from branches on the tree of life. That tree is one of many trees that make up a forest of knowledge. This forest is forever growing and changing based on the configuration of the soil, the directionality of the sun, and even the age of the earth. These natural constraints on the growth of the knowledge forest, moreover, are not alone. You, alongside many other human and nonhuman creatures, cultivate the forest, shepherding its growth, distributing its decay, and appropriating portions for your use. That too is curiosity. Curiosity is a growth principle in a forest ecology of knowers and knowns, would-be knowers and would-be knowns. And that ecology shifts and shapes depending on prior growth patterns as well as power struggles and generosities between growers. There is a delightful chance and happenstance to the roots curiosity threads underground and to the branches curiosity weaves in a canopy overhead. But there are also societal logics and neural constraints that often determine which idea trees get nurtured best and celebrated most, at what times and in which places.

Curiosity, after all, like worms and webs, fish and forests, is situated within a larger ecology. What then are the relevant distribution patterns, relationships, and interdependencies within which curious thought functions? Throughout this book, we aspire to ecological validity by studying curiosity in situ. Noticing it where it lives, specifically where it lives between things. Between competing knowledge networks, between old nodes and new, and between knowledge network builders. Curiosity lives on the edge. It walks a line. As such, it is impossible to formally isolate. It cannot be reduced to simple, singular acts, nor can it be unified and relieved of all its cracks. In reimagining curiosity, we bring neuroscience and psychology, philosophy and literature, to converge on the real story: curiosity as a network practice, a relational practice.

And why does this matter? It matters in part simply because this is our curious minds at work—for a moment, in a delightful act of freedom, we have found a space to breathe. More fundamentally, it matters because not all curious minds are free. Nor are all curiosities given the space to breathe. Woolf’s frustrations still ring painfully in our ears. And she is far from alone. Ta-Nehisi Coates, reflecting on his own Black boyhood in Baltimore, regrets that schools exacted “compliance” more than they encouraged “curiosity.”14 Similar testaments abound, showing the ways in which societal inequities refuse Latinx and Indigenous people, disabled and neurodiverse people, and LGBTQ people, among other groups, the right to curiosity.15 We think deeply of all the underrepresented scientists and theorists whose innovative work is repeatedly passed over.16 And we ask, How might we thatch our lines together? How might we help this forest grow? What we offer here is but one line of flight—one by which we stretch our brains and our hearts out beyond the brink of the world.17
